# Heaps
Heap data structures and their applications.

## Binary Heap
Reference: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap].

This is a typical implementation, storing all elements in a vector. A hash map is used to map the element key (int value) to its index position in the vector.

## Binomial Heap
Reference: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_heap].

This is implemented using a list of root trees of BinomialNodes, where each node points to its parent node, its right sibling node and its child node.

## Next
* Weak Heap
* 2-3 Heap
* Dijkstra's shortest path using these heaps
* Performance tests
